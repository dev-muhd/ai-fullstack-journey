# AI Full-Stack Journey

This repository documents my path to becoming a full-stack AI engineer.

Everything here is learned by building — not passive tutorials.

---

## Objective

Develop strong foundations in:

- Python fundamentals
- Backend engineering
- Machine learning
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Full-stack AI systems

## Philosophy

- Validate before you compute
- Build before you consume
- Learn deeply, not quickly
- Consistency over motivation

Day 1 started with Python fundamentals.

This repository will evolve into production-grade AI systems.

# Day 1 – Python Fundamentals

## 🧠 Objective

Understand and apply core Python basics through a mini project.

---

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- Variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`)
- Type casting
- User input handling
- `raise` for defensive programming
- `try / except / finally`
- Input validation before derived calculations
- `.format()` vs f-strings

---

## 🛠 Mini Project

Built a personal information collector that:

- Accepts user input
- Validates age and height
- Uses `raise` for invalid values
- Handles errors with `try/except`
- Computes derived values (months, cm)
- Outputs formatted results

---

## 🔑 Key Lesson

Never compute from unvalidated input.

Validation comes first.
Derived values come second.
